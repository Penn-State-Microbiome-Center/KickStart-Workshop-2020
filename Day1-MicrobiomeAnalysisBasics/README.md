# Day 1- Microbiome Analysis Basics

## Goals
1. Get an introduction into the microbiome field.

2. Learn the experimental methods required to go from concieving a microbiome study to completing it, including sample collection, DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis. 

2. Practice designing a microbiome experiment.
